# Full Stack ToDo App

This is a full stack To-Do List web application built using:

- ✅ **Spring Boot** (Backend)
- ⚛️ **React** (Frontend)
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** (Database)

The project is more focused on the **backend** logic, as I'm currently learning Spring Boot in-depth. The frontend is functional and minimal, built just enough to support the app features while I focus on backend skills.

## 🛠 Features

- User signup and login
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as done
