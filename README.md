These screenshots show tasks after being added:

- You can mark a task as **finished** (‚úî green button) or delete it (‚ùå red button).
- If not finished, the task stays in "In Progress" state.
- Tasks are managed individually and provide clear feedback with each action.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database View

#### üë• User Table
![UserInDB](./ScreenShots/UserInDB.jpg)

This shows how users are stored in the PostgreSQL database, including ID, username, and login details.

#### üìã Task Table
![TaskInDB](./ScreenShots/TaskInDB.jpg)

Each task record includes:
- A **foreign key (user_id)** that links the task to the user who created it.
- This is a classic **Many-to-One** relationship ‚Äî many tasks belong to one user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend ‚Äì Spring Boot

The backend is where the main development effort is focused. It handles:

- RESTful API endpoints
- User and task management
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Clean architecture with layered structure (Controller, Service, Repository)

### üîß Tech Used:

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot 3.5**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Maven**

> Full details and implementation explained in [`BackEnd/ToDoList/README.md`](./BackEnd/ToDoList/README.md)

---

## üñº Frontend ‚Äì React

The frontend is a simple, functional React app designed to consume the Spring Boot API.

### üé® Tech Used:

- **React**
- **Vite** (for fast bundling)
- **Axios** (for API requests)
- **Formik** (for forms)
- **Inline CSS styling** (no frameworks)

> I'm currently not focused on frontend skills, so this is a minimal UI to interact with the backend features.
